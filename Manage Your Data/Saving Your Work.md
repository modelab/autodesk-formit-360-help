Preserve your designs in multiple formats.

Every time you exit, the software automatically saves the sketch on which you most recently worked. Every time you return to the gallery, you will be prompted to save your sketch.

When a sketch is synchronized to http://360.autodesk.com three files are created in AXM, SAT, and RVT formats (the latter for opening in Revit software-based products). ![](Images/GUID-77322109-D293-4D4B-8291-3E3014A9FFE6-low.jpg) The Revit file can be downloaded locally, and opened directly in Revit

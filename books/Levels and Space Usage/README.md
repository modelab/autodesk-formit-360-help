# Levels and Space Usage

----

See area calculations for objects in a design.

## Enable Levels

1. To set the level datums for the entire sketch, click on the Levels tab of the right-side palette.
2. Hover over the level text and click the blue dimension value to specify the elevations of each level.
3. You can optionally rename the automatically assigned name by double-clicking the name. These level names will be applied to the levels in Revit when the file is converted.
4. Control the levels that are applied to each object in the [Properties tab](GUID-E6029F9A-7F26-43C4-BB18-B6F3B80D661F.htm).

## Properties and Space Usage

FormIt 360 maintains a running report of how much gross floor area is being used by your design.

1. After creating your levels, [apply them to one or more objects in the scene](GUID-E6029F9A-7F26-43C4-BB18-B6F3B80D661F.htm)
2. With nothing selected, open the Properties palette to view how much gross area is being used by summing the area of each floor plate.
3. Click the number next to Target Area to assign a total area for the building program. The Gross Area graph will now show how much area is used against this target total.
4. Click the number next to Site Area to assign the total area for the building site. The Floor Area Ratio number will be calculated using this value and the current Gross Area.

    Like the Revit software, you can use level values to define a vertical height or story within a building sketch.

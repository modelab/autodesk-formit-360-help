# Modify: Extrude, Cut/Offset Faces

----

Push or pull a face, or imprint new shapes on existing ones, or change create new edges offset from the original ones.

A one finger drag extrudes the face, and a two-finger drag extrudes the face while retaining the original edges. The face will move back and forth, you can drag to snap and inference points on other model elements. Tap again to finish moving the face.

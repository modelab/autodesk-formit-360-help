Scale a Group instance while maintaining the relationship to other instances
 

An instance of a Group can be scaled and still maintain the relationship between the different instances of the group even though they are different sizes.

1. Select a Group instance
2. Tap and hold the Group instance to display the Context Menu and tap the Scale button ![](Images/GUID-AA1EDCA0-B86D-4C6D-952F-5A702D29E536-low.png)
3. Edit the scaled Group instance by double-tapping it. Note that the other smaller group instances also react to the change.

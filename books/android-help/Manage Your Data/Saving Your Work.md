When a sketch is synchronized to http://360.autodesk.com three files are created in AXM, SAT, and RVT formats (the latter for opening in Revit software-based products). ![](Images/GUID-77322109-D293-4D4B-8291-3E3014A9FFE6-low.jpg) The Revit file can be downloaded locally, and opened directly in Revit.

Define a geographic location to make use of building performance and climate data with your designs.
 

To maximize the functionality of your designs, you should define the geographic location of your sketch using the Location feature. Setting the location is important when you want to use Building Performance data while designing. See[ Building Performance](../Building Performance/README.md) for more details.

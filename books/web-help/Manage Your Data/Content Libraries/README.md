# Content Libraries

----

Use a personal library of frequently used elements like furniture, building elements, or material base files.
 
NoteTo link to local content, use Google Chrome instead of Firefox or Windows Explorer.
You can store previous projects and site files. Your content library can be stored and linked to from a local folder (in a Drop Box Sync folder for instance), or an [Autodesk 360 Drive](https://360.autodesk.com). To use a content library, click the Content Library icon in the properties panel to the right side of the canvas. Then, click on the 'Link Library' button.![](Images/GUID-FC74216E-0452-400D-97C6-52BBCEC19C38-low.png)

After you add new FormIt sketches (.AXM), .OBJ, or .STL files to your content file structure - either locally or on A360 Drive - you will need to refresh the Content Library in FormIt. To do this click the Link Library button again, and either navigate to your local library, or choose the A360 option and FormIt will refresh the list automatically.

If you have linked your library locally, and then start a new FormIt web session, you will need to re-link the Content Library. When you click the Content Library tab, you will see a web browser specific dialog asking permission to link to a local folder. You need to navigate to your top level content library folder.

# Joining a Session

----

Become part of a collaboration.
 

* Click the link provided to you by the session host, or paste the link URL into your Web browser address bar. Login to [Autodesk 360](https://360.autodesk.com), you will be added as a collaborator, and your icon will appear on the toolbar. When you are done collaborating, just click the 'Leave Sharing Session' option from the drop down menu under your picture.

Please note that joining a session will require you to start FormIt in a new tab. Additionally, if you leave a session as a guest collaborator, a copy of the sketch will NOT be saved to your A360 account.

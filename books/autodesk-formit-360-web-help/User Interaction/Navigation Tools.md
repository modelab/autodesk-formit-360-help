| 3D View   |   This is the perspective view that FormIt 360 starts in. You can orbit, pan, and zoom to view and edit your model.   |
| Fly-Through Mode   |   Enter a First person perspective mode at ground level. Your editing tools are disabled, but you can walk or fly-through your model using your keyboard and space bar. When you exit this mode using the esc key, you return to 3D View mode, your point of view is maintained.   |

    * *Color*: When a material has both texture and color, the two are multiplied together.
    * *Bump*: Load a texture to apply bumpiness based on the image.
    * *Cutout*: Load a black and white bitmap. The white areas will appear solid and the black areas will be transparent.
    * *Opacity*: A higher value means the material will be more transparent.
    * *Gloss*: A higher value will add a shiny gloss effect to the material.
    * *Reflection Direct*: A higher value will increase the amount of reflectivity visible when looking directly at a face.
    * *Reflection: Oblique*: A higher value will increase the amount of reflectivity visible when looking at a face from an oblique angle.
5. Click OK to save the changes to the material.

> Things get really interesting when you start to push and pull the
objects you have placed. Single click will allow you to select a single
face, edge or, different than older version of FormIt, a corner or
point. If you did not complete the last section, click the **Gallery button**

### Exercise 1 – Modifying Faces

1. **Single click one** of the **faces** of the **objects**

2. You can **immediately** **drag that face** to **push** or **pull** it no need to invoke a separate tool. You can **use** the **snapping** to snap this **face aligned** with **other objects** in the scene.

3. As with move, you can **click the temporary dimension** or use **Tab**
key to **define** the **amount** of **move** .

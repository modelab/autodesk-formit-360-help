2. Make the copied Group unique, edit it and name it **Roof** . Import and paint the Roof with the material **Concrete &gt; White**.
3. Create the lower terrace by following the plan and using the Rectangle tool ( R ) **55' 3" long and 22'-7 3/4" wide** and extruding it **1'**. Group this and name it **Lower Terrace**.
4. Move it **2'2"** off the ground.
5. Import and paint the Floor 1 and Lower Terrace with the material **Stone &gt; Travertine**
6. Edit the Travertine material in both groups. Click the Color value and change it to 190 to lighten the effect of the material. ![](./images/7d23f82c-2f5f-4e09-b3bf-24841cccbd0a.png)

Collaboration
-------------

And now for “one last thing!” Real time collaboration. FormIt allows multiple users (on any combination of iOS or Web clients) to collaboratively edit a FormIt model – while seeing all of their changes in real time!

### Exercise 1 – Start a Collaboration Session
1. Start a session – this will start a collaboration session.

2. You can now email a link to a colleague. When they open the link, they will be asked to log into A360 and then you can start collaborating immediately.

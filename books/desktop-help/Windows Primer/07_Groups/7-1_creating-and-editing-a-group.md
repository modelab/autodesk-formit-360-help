4. It is important to name Groups as you will have many of them to keep track of. To name the Group, Double-click to start the edit mode and then open the Properties palette to name the Group "**main building**". ![](./images/93c9106d-7676-4cd7-b5e2-b00a56c4e30f.png)

**Note** : *Each Group has their own undo/redo "stack" that is distinct
from the top level project.*

Levels
------

Levels allow you to slice masses into individual floors and calculate
gross area for the entire project - or by building. Levels will
translate to Revit when the file is converted.

### Create , Edit, and Apply Levels
1. You can create new levels using the Level tab on the Levels Palette.
2. Click Add Level four times to add a single Level at 0’0, 2'2 , 4’6 and 15’8 (you can also click the ++ icon to create multiple levels – handy for tall buildings)
3. Edit the Level name. Name the first one **Level 1, Terrace, Floor 1, and Top of Cornice** – these level names will now translate into Revit.

4. Select the main massing and in the Properties tab, click Apply Levels and only check Main Floor. The Properties tab now reads the area of this mass.

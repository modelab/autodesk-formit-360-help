###Setting Location
---



> Setting your projectâ€™s location in the world is important for the accuracy of down-stream analyses. It also allows you to import a scaled satellite image to use as a background reference.



### Set Location:



1. Set location to *Farnsworth House*:
	- Type ***Farnsworth House*** in the search field. Google Maps will fill in the actual location.

	- As soon as you commit the location search, location is set to the center of the view.

	- You can now click Finish to set the location and return to the 3D scene. Or you may optionally import a scaled satellite image.

	- Satellite image is imported to scale with True North facing up.
	- Go to the Visual Styles palette and enable **North Arrow** to see an interactive indicator of true north.
	- Once back in the 3D scene, select the satellite image by doubleclicking. Open the Properties panel and lower the transparency slider about 1/3.

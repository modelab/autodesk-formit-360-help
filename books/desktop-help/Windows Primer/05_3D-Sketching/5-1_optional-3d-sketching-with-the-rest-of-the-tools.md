### Optional â€“ 3D Sketching with the rest of the tools

The following exercise is not critical to finishing the house. It will
allow you to experiment with some of the other 3D Sketching tools.

1. Click to open the Sketching Toolbar.

2. Select the Arc tool.
	- Click to define the first and second point similar to the Line tool.
	- The third drag defines the radius of the circle that defines the arc.
	- Note: as with all sketching tools, you can use the red snap points to snap to other objects in the scene.

3. Select the Spline tool.
	- Click to define any number of points to draw a spline

4. Select the Circle tool.
	- Hover and Click to define the center point of the circle.
	- Click and drag to define the radius of the circle.

**Important Note:** *When you snap any curve segment to any other point,
line or object face/edge/point, the objects will now be joined as one
object. To avoid this, we will use Groups in a later exercise.*

3D Sketching
------------

>Placing primitives is fine, but the real power of FormIt lies in the
ability to sketch in 3D. You got a sneak peak at the power of the
snapping system when you used the Rotate tool in the last exercise.
If you did not complete the last section, click the File &gt; Open and
choose **farnsworth01.axm** from the FormIt Primer folder.

### 3D Sketching with lines

1. We are going to first Group the image plane. This will prevent sketched lines from "sticking" to it. Select the plane by double-clicking it, right-click and choose Group (G).

2. Click the Pencil to open the Sketching Toolbar.

3. Choose the Line tool (L). ![](./images/b73dbf13-d655-42fa-ae12-164e8bda28ad.png)

4. You can immediately start to sketch using straight lines segments.
	- The red, green and blue axes display to allow you to sketch in 3D without leaving the tool.
	- The purple axis displays an axis relative to the lines you are currently drawing.
	- Hold down the Shift key while dragging a line segment to lock to the current axis.

5. Start with creating a rectangle on the ground plane.
 - Click Settings &gt; turn off Snap to Grid (S G)
 - With the Line tool, click on one corner of the imported sketch. Drag along to define one edge of the upper terrace.
 - Use the Tab key to input exact dimensions. Make the long side **77'-4 1/8"** and the short side **28'-8**".
 - Press Esc. You are back in Select mode. You can now select the top face and immediately pull the volume up **12'2"**.

**Note** : *the red and green axes keep you at 90 degrees. When you draw
at an angle to the grid, a purple guide will allow you to stay 90
degrees relative to your current line.*

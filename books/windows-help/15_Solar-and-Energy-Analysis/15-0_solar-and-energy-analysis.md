### Shadows
Setting the location allows you to accurately analyze how sun shadows ill fall and affect your design – allowing you to make better ecisions.
1. Click on the Sun Icon and check **Display Shadows**.
2. Move the Day and Hour sliders to see the shadow effects. Note in this house how the covered terrace is shaded during the hottest hours of the summer months – surely not an accident but a matter of design!

### Solar Analysis
1. From the same Sun menu, click **Solar Analysis**
2. Click on the surfaces you want to study and click **Analyze**
3. The Month Peak setting displays the peak solar insolation in BTU/sq. ft for that month. Hover your cursor over an analyzed surface to get a specific value. ![](./images/460060a0-ea3b-4095-af45-40045811be22.png)
4. The Year Cumulative setting displays the cumulative energy for the entire year in KwH/sq. meter. This is useful for gaining an early idea of solar PV potential for surfaces of your design. ![](./images/a9f61dfb-dfc9-4751-b145-b131a69c53cf.png)

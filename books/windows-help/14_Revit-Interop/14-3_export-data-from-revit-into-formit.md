### Export Data from Revit into FormIt

There may be times when you need to bring data from Revit into FormIt â€“ e.g. when you have an existing Revit project that needs an area of the design to be iterated on. Export a 3D scene to the SAT file format from Revit and you will be able to import that data back into FormIt.

**Note** : *Family and category information is not transferred back to FormIt 360.*

# Scale a Group

----

Scale a Group instance while maintaining the relationship to other instances
 

An instance of a Group can be scaled and still maintain the relationship between the different instances of the group even though they are different sizes.

1. Select a Group instance
2. Choose the Scale button ![](Images/GUID-AA1EDCA0-B86D-4C6D-952F-5A702D29E536-low.png) from the context menu and resize the instance using the on screen control
3. Edit the scaled Group instance and note that the other smaller group instances also react to the change - while maintaining their original size.

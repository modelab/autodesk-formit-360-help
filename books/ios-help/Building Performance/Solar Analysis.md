5. Tap the ![](Images/GUID-031D977C-EEAA-44AD-B73D-19FB4A2C0117-low.jpg)symbol to toggle between Month Peak or Year Cumulative. 
    
    Change between Month Peak, which gives the peak solar insolation value in BTU/sq ft (or Wh/sq m) for each month, and Year Cumulative, which gives the total insolation in kw/Sq m. Month Peak is useful for developing a shading strategy for the building fa√ßade. Year Cumulative is useful for determining the potential for photovoltaic cells.
6. Move the slider to vary the time of year.

You can create your own materials based on custom bitmap files.

1. Choose a color for the material. The color will blend with any bitmap that may have been loaded.


* Textures are imported from your Camera Roll or Photo Library. Once imported, you can edit the texture's mapping using the Material Crop tool. You can crop textures to define the vertical and horizontal tile scale in meters or feet.

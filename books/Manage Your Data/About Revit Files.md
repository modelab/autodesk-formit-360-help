# About Revit Files

----

Save your design in a format that Revit can open and use.
 

When a FormIt 360 sketch is synchronized to an [Autodesk 360 Drive](https://360.autodesk.com), an RVT file is automatically created for you. You can download the .RVT and open it in Revit 2015, or other software applications that open Revit files.

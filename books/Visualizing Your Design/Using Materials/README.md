# Using Materials

----

Enrich and enhance designs using Materials to add detail.
 

The Material Editor is located in the right-side palette. In the Editor, you can create new materials and add them to your Material Library. To add color to a material, you can use the color picker to accurately set the tint for the material or select a predefined color swatch.

* You can use one of the sample materials from the included library, you can create your own, or you can import a material from the Autodesk Material Library (available for the [FormIt 360 Pro Subscription](http://www.autodesk.com/products/formit-360/try-buy) only.) Materials allow you to add detail to the geometry in your sketch.
